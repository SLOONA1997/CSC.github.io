<br><h1 align='center'>DIGITAL LITERACY</h1>
<h2><p align='left'>In India, across over 6,50,000 villages  and 2,50,000 panchayats represented by 3 million panchayat members. Approx 40% population is living below poverty line, illiteracy rate is more than 25-30% and digital literacy is almost no-existent among more than 90% of India’s population.
While the country boasts the world’s second fastest-growing mobile market, it is lagging behind when it comes to internet connectivity. Connecting the community and its members to the world through the Internet is becoming increasingly essential for community vitality for the development and social progress in recent years.
According to the IAMAI report, there were about 30,000,000 internet users in rural India in December 2011. The 50 per cent spike leading to the expected 45,000,000 by December 2012 is primarily driven by mobile internet access, community centers and cyber cafes. However, within rural communities, the task to empower using ICT can still be challenging, but many of us have been dedicating time and energies to empower trouble torn community.</p></h2>

<h1> DIGITAL LITERACY DRIVE IN RURAL AREAS</h1>
<p align ='left'><h2>The Union Cabinet has approved ‘Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan’ (PMGDISHA) to make 6 crore rural households digitally literate. The outlay for this project is Rs.2,351.38 crore to usher in digital literacy in rural India by March,.2019. This is in line with the announcement made by Finance Minister in the Union Budget 2016-17.
PMGDISHA is expected to be one of the largest digital literacy programmes in the world. Under the scheme, 25 lakh candidates will be trained in the FY 2016-17; 275 lakh in the FY 2017-18; and 300 lakh in the FY 2018-19. To ensure equitable geographical reach, each of the 250,000 Gram Panchayats would be expected to register an average of 200-300 candidates.
Digitally literate persons would be able to operate computers/digital access devices (like tablets, smart phones, etc.), send and receive emails, browse Internet, access Government Services, search for information, undertaking cashless transactions, etc. and hence use IT to actively participate in the process of nation building.</h2></p>

<h1>Indian Budget 2016 – A digital flavour</h1>
<p align="left"><h2>Annual Budgets are always awaited keenly in the country and this year’s budget was no exception. The Finance Minister of India presented his third consecutive Union Budget 2016 on the floor of the Lower House of the Indian Parliament on 29th February, 2016.  While much about the Indian Budget has written in the sense that the Budget will help India, however, lot of aspects pertaining to the Budget has not been highlighted.  I now look at those aspects of the Budget which impact the digital ecosystem.<br>Given the thrust of Government of India on implementing the Digital India Program and trying to transform India into a knowledge economy and society by the year 2018, the Union Budget has focused on the need to derive greater benefit from Indian demographic advantage.  The Budget has noted that almost 12 crores (120 million ) households in India do not have computers and hence are unlikely to have digital literate persons. In this light, the Budget has approvingly noted two schemes to promote digital literacy — National Digital Literacy Mission and Digital Saksharta Abhiyan  (DISHA). The Budget has planned to launch new digital literacy mission scheme for rural India to cover around 6 crore additional households in the next three years</p></h2>
